# CSS Animation Playground

This project is a simple in-browser tool for building and testing CSS animations. It lets you create keyframes on a timeline, edit their styles, preview the result, and share your animation via a single URL.

## Features
- Visual timeline editor with draggable keyframes
- Built-in presets (fade, bounce, slide)
- Live preview and generated CSS code
- Share animations using encoded data in the URL

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to use the playground.
